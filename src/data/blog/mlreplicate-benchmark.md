## Abstract

Autonomous research systems capable of generating complete scientific manuscripts have advanced rapidly, yet robust and realistic evaluation frameworks have failed to keep pace. To bridge this gap, we introduce **MLReplicate**, an end-to-end benchmark evaluating autonomous research systems on machine learning reproducibility.

The benchmark was constructed from ICML 2025 outstanding papers reformulated into standardized input specifications and evaluated across 6 state-of-the-art research systems: **AI Scientist-V1**, **AI Scientist-V2**, **Agent Laboratory**, **CycleResearcher**, **AI Researcher**, and **Tiny Scientist**, yielding 45 generated manuscripts, with 3 failed experiments.

Outputs are assessed using a dual-protocol approach that combines automated conference-style review and structured expert human evaluation, while tracking computational cost, runtime, and the amount of required human intervention.

## Key Findings

- The automated conference-style review **accepted 10 out of 37 valid submissions**; an additional 8 were desk-rejected for failing to meet the minimum page threshold
- Human reviewers consistently identified **methodological flaws, hallucinated experimental results, and reproducibility failures** across all systems
- **59% of accepted automated reviews contained fabricated or unsupported claims**
- Neither token budget nor computational cost predicts output quality: the **cheapest system outperforms the most resource-intensive system** in human evaluation, despite a 38-fold difference in input tokens
- **Autonomous research workflow design matters more than the scale of compute**

MLReplicate exposes a substantial gap between current autonomous research systems and genuine scientific rigor, and establishes a practical, extensible evaluation framework for systematic progress toward trustworthy AI-driven scientific discovery.
